I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Arizona majoring in astronomy and physics with a mathematics minor. I'm currently researching high redshift quasars with [Xiaohui Fan](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/xiaohui-fan) and [Jinyi Yang](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/jinyi-yang). Nearly all galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their center, with masses ranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass of the Sun. Quasars are thought to be supermassive black holes surrounded by a disk of gas. As particles in the disk fall towards the event horizon, they crash into each other and get heated to extreme temperatures. The disk gets so hot that it begins to glow, sometimes outshining its entire host galaxy which can have trillions of stars! These cosmic monsters are fascinating for many reasons. Quasars are so bright that they can be seen at huge distances, allowing astronomers to catch glimpses of conditions in the early Universe. They also give us information about how supermassive black holes and galaxies grow together and evolve over time. Additionally, quasars are like a backlight illuminating the faint clouds of gas and dust between us and distant galaxies, making them a unique probe of the so-called "intergalactic medium", or IGM.

I work with the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) (DESI), identifying quasars at z > 4.5 through visual inspection and spectral analysis. This project is described in detail in the publication Yang, Jinyi; Fan, Xiaohui; Gupta, Ansh et al., 2023, Submitted, [DESI z > 5 Quasar Survey. I. A First Sample of 400 New Quasars at z ~ 4.7 - 6.6.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230201777Y/abstract). I'm also investigating the quasar correlation function, a measure of how "clustered" these objects are at different points in time.

Last summer, I took part in an REU at the University of Kansas working with [Allison Kirkpatrick](https://physics.ku.edu/people/kirkpatrick-allison) on ionization conditions in JWST [CEERS](https://ceers.github.io/) galaxies. About 400,000 years after the big bang, the hot, dense plasma that filled the universe settled into an ocean of neutral hydrogen gas. This caused all of space to become transparent, freeing light that had been trapped in an opaque sea of particles for millenia. Without this phase transition, we would not be able to see distant galaxies. However, within a billion years of the big bang, high energy radiation from stars stripped the electrons away from this neutral hydrogen, causing the space between galaxies to once again be filled with plasma. Understanding the causes and evolution of this "cosmic reionization" is a major goal of extragalactic astronomy. I investigated the ability of young star-forming galaxies to contribute to reionization using data from the NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. Our sample included measuremenets of the brightness of spectral lines in galaxies with a redshift from 1-7, the most distant of which are nearly 13 billion years old. By observing the relative strength of certain spectral lines, we can glean information about how much high energy radiation is present in these galaxies. I probed the relationship between "line ratios" and the galaxies' masses and the rate at which they form new stars. By examining the spread of these quantites throughout time, I revealed a rich diversity of physical conditions in young galaxies. My results further suggest that the "specific star formation rate" of a galaxy is a uniquely strong predictor of the ionization of its gas. This work probes the effect of young stars on their surroundings and examines the relationship between a galaxyâ€™s radiation field and the ionization of its surroundings.

	<figcaption>This is a plot I created which displays the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Earlier (younger) galaxies are to the right, and galaxies higher up form stars at a propotionally higher rate. Galaxies in the past formed stars more frequently, so I show the emperically derived main sequence from Elbaz et al. (2011). My results show galaxies that are both "starbursting", of forming stars at a high rate, and "quenched", or barely generating them at all.</figcaption>

Previously, I conducted research on artificial intelligence to detect fake scientific articles with [Christopher Impey](https://profiles.arizona.edu/person/cimpey). This work involved collecting and tagging scientific articles and curating datasets of real and fake writing which were used as training and validation data for a natural language processing neural network. Our preliminary results show that the AI can successfully differentiate between real and fake scientific writing. Hopefully our model can be used to combat pseudoscience and misinformation and give the public a tool to navigate a landscape of sensationalist and misleading science writing. As part of this project, I also created educational astronomy videos for the [Active Galactic](https://www.youtube.com/@ActiveGalactic) YouTube channel. I hosted, edited, wrote, and researched for a variety of videos in my time with the group, with my work accumulating tens of thousands of views. Furthermore, I edited and wrote questions for the Coursera course [Knowing the Universe: History and Philosophy of Astronomy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/knowing-the-universe).

In the future, I aim to continue researching "active galactic nuclei" (AGN), the family of astronomical objects which includes quasars, in graduate school. My career goal is to become a research professor studying AGN. I also hope to continue taking part in science outreach through videos, written content, and participation in community events, so I can spread the deep appreciation I have for science and share the wonder and excitement I feel working on my research every day.
