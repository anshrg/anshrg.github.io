I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Arizona majoring in astronomy and physics with a mathematics minor. I'm currently researching high redshift quasars with [Xiaohui Fan](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/xiaohui-fan) and [Jinyi Yang](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/jinyi-yang). Nearly all galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their center, with masses ranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass of the Sun. Quasars are thought to be supermassive black holes surrounded by a disk of gas. As particles in the disk fall towards the event horizon, they crash into each other and get heated to extreme temperatures. The disk gets so hot that it begins to glow, sometimes outshining its entire host galaxy which can have trillions of stars! These cosmic monsters are fascinating for many reasons. Quasars are so bright that they can be seen at huge distances, allowing astronomers to catch glimpses of conditions in the early Universe. They also give us information about how supermassive black holes and galaxies grow together and evolve over time. Additionally, quasars are like a backlight illuminating the faint clouds of gas and dust between us and distant galaxies, making them a unique probe of the so-called "intergalactic medium", or IGM.

I work with the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) (DESI), identifying quasars at z > 4.5 through visual inspection and spectral analysis. This project is described in detail in the publication Yang, Jinyi; Fan, Xiaohui; Gupta, Ansh et al., 2023, Submitted, [DESI z > 5 Quasar Survey. I. A First Sample of 400 New Quasars at z ~ 4.7 - 6.6.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230201777Y/abstract). I'm also investigating the quasar correlation function, a measure of how "clustered" these objects are at different points in time.

This summer, I'm taking part in an REU at the University of Kansas working with [Allison Kirkpatrick](https://physics.ku.edu/people/kirkpatrick-allison) on ionization conditions in JWST [CEERS](https://ceers.github.io/) galaxies. I'm using data from the NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope to identify the brightness of spectral lines in galaxies with a redshift around 1-2. By observing the relative strength of certain spectral lines, we can glean information about how much high energy radiation is present in these galaxies. I will then probe the relationship between ionization conditions and the galaxies' mass, star formation rate, and redshift, and search for quasars within the sample.

Previously, I conducted research on artificial intelligence to detect fake scientific articles with [Christopher Impey](https://profiles.arizona.edu/person/cimpey). This work involved collecting and tagging scientific articles and curating datasets of real and fake writing which were used as training and validation data for a natural language processing neural network. Our preliminary results show that the AI can successfully differentiate between real and fake scientific writing. Hopefully our model can be used to combat pseudoscience and misinformation and give the public a tool to navigate a landscape of sensationalist and misleading science writing. As part of this project, I also created educational astronomy videos for the [Active Galactic](https://www.youtube.com/@ActiveGalactic) YouTube channel. I hosted, edited, wrote, and researched for a variety of videos in my time with the group, with my work accumulating tens of thousands of views. Furthermore, I edited and wrote questions for the Coursera course [Knowing the Universe: History and Philosophy of Astronomy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/knowing-the-universe).

In the future, I aim to continue researching "active galactic nuclei" (AGN), the family of astronomical objects which includes quasars, in graduate school. My career goal is to become a research professor studying AGN. I also hope to continue taking part in science outreach through videos, written content, and participation in community events, so I can spread the deep appreciation I have for science and share the wonder and excitement I feel working on my research every day.
