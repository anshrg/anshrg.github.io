excerpt: "I'm a fourth year astronomy and physics undergraduate student at the University of Arizona. My current research involves high redshift quasars, some of the brightest and most distant objects we can observe. I'm also passionate about science education and outreach. If you're interested in any of these topics, you're in the right place!"

  - excerpt: '"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed." ― Albert Einstein '

    title: "My Research"
    excerpt: "Quasars are supermassive black holes surrounded by a searing hot disk of gas and dust. I work with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), identifying high redshift quasars through visual inspection and spectral analysis. I’m investigating how clustered these objects are over time to see how they co-evolved with the Universe."

Through education, I hope to inspire people to learn more about our Universe and experience the same sense of wonder I feel working on my research. Outreach is the best tool we have to engage with the public and inspire the next generation of scientists."

    title: "About Me"
    excerpt: "I've had a love for astronomy since elementary school. It amazes me that I get to look at quasars billions of lightyears away and billions of years old. Each quasar's host galaxy can have trillions of stars, many of which may have habitable exoplanets. This fact shows how small we are and puts our human differences into perspective. Helping people understand the scale of the cosmos can bring us closer together, and I hope to play my own small part in the quest to explore the Universe."
